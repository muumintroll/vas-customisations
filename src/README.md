# Customisations Source Folder

This folder contains all the relevant sub-folders for the appropriate content that you may wish to add. Refer to the readme file in each directory for more details.

The `main.js` file is the *entry point* of your customisations. Don't forget to add dependencies to your javascript files when you create a new file.
